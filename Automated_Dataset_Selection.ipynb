This data collection comprises data for two surveys: a\\\\nsurvey of households and a survey of employers. Multistage area\\\\nprobability sampling of adult residents took place in four\\\\nmetropolitan areas: Atlanta (April 1992-September 1992), Boston (May\\\\n1993-November 1994), Detroit (April-September 1992), and Los Angeles\\\\n(September 1993-August 1994). The combined four-city data file in Part\\\\n1 contains data on survey questions that were asked in households in\\\\nat least two of the four survey cities. Questions on labor market\\\\ndynamics included industry, hours worked per week, length of time on\\\\njob, earnings before taxes, size of employer, benefits provided,\\\\ninstances of harassment and discrimination, and searching for work\\\\nwithin particular areas of the metropolis in which the respondent\\\\nresided. Questions covering racial attitudes and attitudes about\\\\ninequality centered on the attitudes and beliefs that whites, Blacks,\\\\nLatinos, and Asians hold about one another, including amount of\\\\ndiscrimination, perceptions about wealth and intelligence, ability to\\\\nbe self-supporting, ability to speak English, involvement with drugs\\\\nand gangs, the fairness of job training and educational assistance\\\\npolicies, and the fairness of hiring and promotion\\\\npreferences. Residential segregation issues were studied through\\\\nmeasures of neighborhood quality and satisfaction, and preferences\\\\nregarding the racial/ethnic mix of neighborhoods. Other topics\\\\nincluded residence and housing, neighborhood characteristics, family\\\\nincome structure, networks and social functioning, and interviewer\\\\nobservations. Demographic information on household respondents was\\\\nalso elicited, including length of residence, education, housing\\\\nstatus, monthly rent or mortgage payment, marital status, gender, age,\\\\nrace, household composition, citizenship status, language spoken in\\\\nthe home, ability to read and speak English, political affiliation,\\\\nand religion. The data in Part 2 represent a telephone survey of\\\\ncurrent business establishments in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los\\\\nAngeles carried out between spring 1992 and spring 1995 to learn about\\\\nhiring and vacancies, particularly for jobs requiring just a high\\\\nschool education. An employer size-weighted, stratified, probability\\\\nsample (approximately two-thirds of the cases) was drawn from regional\\\\nemployment directories, and a probability sample (the other third of\\\\nthe cases) was drawn from the current or most recent employer reported\\\\nby respondents to the household survey in Part 1. Employers were\\\\nqueried about characteristics of their firms, including composition of\\\\nthe firm\\'s labor force, vacant positions, the person most recently\\\\nhired and his or her salary, hours worked per week, educational\\\\nqualifications, promotions, the firm\\'s recruiting and hiring methods,\\\\nand demographic information for the respondent, job applicants, the\\\\nfirm\\'s customers, and the firm\\'s labor force, including age,\\\\neducation, race, and gender.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],52,\"\\\\\"10.3886/ICPSR02535.v3\\\\\" OR \\\\\": Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, 1992-1994: [Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles]\\\\\"\",\"http://web.stanford.edu/group/ssds/dewidocs/icpsr2535/cb2535hs.pdf\",\"Data from: Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, 1992-1994: [Atlanta,...\",\"Bobo, Lawrence;  Krysan, Maria;  Charles, Camille Zubrinsky;  Massagli, Michael;  Oliver, Melvin;  Farley, Reynolds;  Tilly, Chris;  Johnson, James;  Bluestone, Barry;  Browne, Irene;  Danziger, Sheldon;  Moss, Philip;  Green, Gary P.;  Holzer, Harry;  Kirschenman, Joleen\"],\"xKklgHlFHhgRL/kdAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Non Public Schools\"],[\"https://boston.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/non-public-schools/\",\"boston.opendatasoft.com\",,,\"opendatasoft.com\"],[[\"http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0046426a3e4340a6b025ad52b41be70a_1\",\"bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com\",,,\"arcgis.com\"]],,,,,[\"tpl\",\"schools\",\"public\",\"open\",\"non\",\"bps\",\"boston\",\"data\"],,[\"excel\",\"geojson\",\"csv\",\"json\"],,,,,,,,,\"Jul 28, 2016\",,,,,,,,[[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eThis point datalayer shows the locations of schools in Massachusetts.

Each research team was responsible for identifying the 15 organizations in their city that fit the criteria of largest 501(c)(3): secular hospital, Protestant hospital, Catholic hospital, Jewish hospital, art museum, symphony orchestra, United Way, institution of higher education, Junior League, community foundation, YMCA, YWCA, secular family services, Catholic family services, and Jewish family services. The process resulted in a board-level data set of about ninety organizations that would be directly comparable across cities; researchers then collected demographic information on the trustees of each organization during the years 1931, 1961, and 1991. Researchers collected data on 8,926 individual trustees from 289 separate boards (approximately 15 organizations\\' boards for each of six cities over three different time periods).

This data collection comprises data for two surveys: a survey of households and a survey of employers. Multistage area probability sampling of adult residents took place in four metropolitan areas: Atlanta (April 1992-September 1992), Boston (May 1993-November 1994), Detroit (April-September 1992), and Los Angeles (September 1993-August 1994). The combined four-city data file in Part 1 contains data on survey questions that were asked in households in at least two of the four survey cities. Questions on labor market dynamics included industry, hours worked per week, length of time on job, earnings before taxes, size of employer, benefits provided, instances of harassment and discrimination, and searching for work within particular areas of the metropolis in which the respondent resided. Questions covering racial attitudes and attitudes about inequality centered on the attitudes and beliefs that whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians hold about one another, including amount of discrimination, perceptions about wealth and intelligence, ability to be self-supporting, ability to speak English, involvement with drugs and gangs, the fairness of job training and educational assistance policies, and the fairness of hiring and promotion preferences. Residential segregation issues were studied through measures of neighborhood quality and satisfaction, and preferences regarding the racial/ethnic mix of neighborhoods. Other topics included residence and housing, neighborhood characteristics, family income structure, networks and social functioning, and interviewer observations. Demographic information on household respondents was also elicited, including length of residence, education, housing status, monthly rent or mortgage payment, marital status, gender, age, race, household composition, citizenship status, language spoken in the home, ability to read and speak English, political affiliation, and religion. The data in Part 2 represent a telephone survey of current business establishments in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles carried out between spring 1992 and spring 1995 to learn about hiring and vacancies, particularly for jobs requiring just a high school education. An employer size-weighted, stratified, probability sample (approximately two-thirds of the cases) was drawn from regional employment directories, and a probability sample (the other third of the cases) was drawn from the current or most recent employer reported by respondents to the household survey in Part 1. Employers were queried about characteristics of their firms, including composition of the firm\\'s labor force, vacant positions, the person most recently hired and his or her salary, hours worked per week, educational qualifications, promotions, the firm\\'s recruiting and hiring methods, and demographic information for the respondent, job applicants, the firm\\'s customers, and the firm\\'s labor force, including age, education, race, and gender.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],52,\"\\\\\": Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, 1992-1994: [Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles]\\\\\"\",\"http://web.stanford.edu/group/ssds/dewidocs/icpsr2535/cb2535hs.pdf\",\"Data from: Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, 1992-1994: [Atlanta,...\"],\"LZqzazdUnLbktRGPAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Financial Records and General Administrative Records, 1994-1997\"],[\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId\\\\u003ddoi:10.7910/DVN/KYH1VP\",\"dataverse.harvard.edu\",\"Harvard Dataverse\",\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu\",\"harvard.edu\"],,,,,,[\"Teacher Training\",\"Social Sciences\",\"Public health -- Research grants -- United States.\",\"Public health -- Research -- United States.\",\"Preventive health services for teenagers.\",\"Preventive Health Services\",\"Physical education teachers -- Training of -- Massachusetts -- Boston.\",\"Physical education and training -- Massachusetts -- Boston.\",\"Physical education and training\",\"Obesity in children -- Prevention.\",\"Health Surveys\",\"Health education (Middle school) -- Curricula.\",\"Health surveys -- Massachusetts -- Boston.\",\"Medicine, Health and Life Sciences\",\"Pediatric Obesity -- prevention \\\\u0026 control\"],,,,,[[,,[,\"The Harvard Medical Library does not hold copyright on all the materials in the collection.

MTO was a demonstration program: its approach combined tenant-based housing vouchers with location restrictions and housing counseling. MTO was also a randomized social experiment, carefully designed and rigorously implemented to test the effects of this approach on participating families. The interim evaluation included the collection of data on a wide range of outcomes that could potentially be affected by the MTO intervention. These outcomes fit into 6 study domains: (1) mobility, housing, and neighborhood, (2) adult and child physical and mental health, (3) child educational achievement, (4) youth delinquency and risky behavior, (5) adult and youth employment and earnings, and (6) household income and public assistance receipt. The restricted access data being made available through ICPSR includes many such analytic variables constructed from surveys and administrative data.

For the first wave of the study, between March 1999 and December 1999, a random sample of approximately 2,400 households with children in low-income neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio were selected for interviews. Forty percent of the families interviewed were receiving cash welfare payments at the time of the interview. Each household had a child aged 0 to 4 or aged 10 to 14 at the time of the interview. The child and the child\\'s primary female caregiver are the focus of the study. Extensive baseline information was gathered at the initial personal interview with the caregivers, tested younger children were assessed, and older children were interviewed. All interviews were conducted in-person using a computerized instrument. The third wave of data collection took place between February 2005 and January 2006, when the focal children were aged 5 to 10 or aged 15 to 20.  Between May 2005 and May 2006, interviews were conducted with the teachers of the focal children.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],413,\"\\\\\"10.3886/ICPSR04701.v7\\\\\" OR \\\\\"Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three-City Study\\\\\"\",,,\"Angel, Ronald;  Burton, Linda;  Chase-Lansdale, P.

Conducted in Boston, the survey was designed to examine how adults manage tasks in three domains of life -- work, family, and health. Further goals were to describe the subjective experience of goal attainment in midlife and to link it with objective measures of short-term longitudinal changes and cognitive functioning. During the national study, the Boston area was intentionally oversampled in order to create a subset to be used for in-depth study of management processes in midlife. \\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eThe Boston study began six months after the national study, and consisted of three interviews: a 30-minute phone interview followed by a 20-minute mail questionnaire (Time 1), a 90-minute in-person combination of cognitive tests, cortisol testing, photograph taking, and interview (Time 2), and a 30-minute phone interview (Time 3), conducted at six-month intervals.  The focus was on projects related to family, work, and health that participants were working on during the period of the study. Each successive interview investigated participants\\' assessments of their progress in the present, recollection of six months in the past, and prediction six months into the future. Two waves of data collection were completed for this study. There were 151 respondents who participated in the first wave, 151 respondents who participated in both waves, and 26 additional respondents who participated in the second wave of data collection.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eAt Time 1, participants generated a list of two important family, work, and health tasks, then chose one of each as the most important in that domain. For each of the most important tasks, questions were asked about deadlines, whether participants were doing tasks because they had to do them, felt that they should do them, or chose to do them, and whether participants were doing tasks for themselves, others, or both. All six projects were ranked according to importance, and participants divided all their time into percentages spent on family, work, and health. The majority of questions on the mail questionnaire at Time 1 were taken from the Midlife Development Inventory (MIDI), the instrument created for the national study. \\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eRespondents were asked to rate their control over health, to make assessments about present, past, and future health, to list any serious illnesses, and to indicate their physical health status.  Study participants also rated their mental health, and discussed stressful life events in the last six months for self, spouse/significant other, parents, and children. Other questions focused on depression, mastery and constraints, community involvement, family, work, and life satisfaction. Scales used included the Ryff Well-Being Scales, the Eysenck Personality Inventory, the Staudinger and Baltes Wisdom Scale (1995), and the Ways of Coping Scale. \\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eTime 2 was done in-person, and included a 50-minute series of cognitive tests followed by a 40-minute interview. The cognitive testing consisted of nine measures of cognitive ability completed in the following order: WAIS Forward Digit Span, WAIS Backward Digit Span, WAIS Vocabulary, counting backwards test, letter comparison test, dual-task test involving the counting backwards and letter comparison tests, WAIS Digit Symbol, Schaie-Thurston Letter Series, and Raven\\'s Advanced Progressive Ma Matrices. \\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eThe Time 2 interview began with a series of questions asking about each of the family, work, and health tasks elicited from the participants in Time 1. Many questions were repeated from the MIDI including rating physical health, family life, work situation, and life overall, rating physical and mental health from poor to excellent, and a measure of stressful life events in the last six months for self, spouse/significant other, parents, and children. Participants were asked to rate how old they felt and how old they looked and to indicate their total yearly household income. Lastly, a series of open-ended questions asked about best and worst aspects of family, work, and health, how participants managed their daily life, the most challenging aspect of life and how it was managed, and what participants found most helpful in carrying out their daily life. Photographs were taken of participants at the conclusion of the interview. \\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eTime 3 asked again about each of the most important family, work, and health tasks elicited from the participants in Time 1. Newly developed questions asked participants about ideas related to middle age, including when the participant believed middle age begins and ends, whether the participant was younger than, in, or older than middle age, the biggest changes in middle age, the best and worst aspects of middle age, whether the participant knew anyone who had had a \\\\\"midlife crisis,\\\\\" and whether he or she would have or had had a midlife crisis. Participants were asked to rate how often they had problems and how often things went well with respect to a list of 26 domains, and how much stress and how much control they had in these domains. Lastly, participants were asked whether they had ever returned to a degree-oriented educational program after being out of school for five or more years, whether they were presently taking classes to further their education, and whether being a participant in the study had influenced the ways they thought about their family, work, and health projects. \\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],,,,\"Midlife in the United States (MIDUS): Boston Longitudinal Study (BOLOS) of...\",\"Lachman, Margie E.\"],\"C3jYBfH5ncvqw1W7AAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Senate Unpassed Legislation 1893, S 199 committee on public charitable institutions - leave to withdraw, SC1/series 231, Petition of D.J.

The initial study (1989) included artists from ten cities: Boston, Cape Cod, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and western Massachusetts. The 1997 wave was conducted in four of the original cities: Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York, and San Francisco. The 2004 wave consisted only of artists in the San Francisco Bay area and included a longitudinal component. The 2007 wave provides the first needs assessment of aging artists in the New York Metro Area. The mailed surveys asked questions about artists\\' work-related, human and social service needs, including health coverage and insurance, life insurance, retirement plans, credit, live/work space, legal and financial service expertise/needs. Like its predecessor Information on Artists III, Information on Artists IV (2011 waves): Still Kicking tries to understand how artists are supported and integrated within their communities, and how their network structures change over time and to understand how performing artists mature into old age-artistically, emotionally, financially and chronologically.

Study staff used the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) to generate primary care provider specific lists of patients meeting the preliminary eligibility criteria. The RPDR is a centralized clinical data registry housing clinical information from Partners HealthCare facilities. Patients meeting the preliminary inclusion criteria within a provider\\'s panel were randomly selected for inclusion on the recruitment master list. The master list was divided into subgroups based on sex, age, and race, and sorted into a random order to ensure random selection from each subgroup. Screening samples of 50 to 100 patients were created and sent to each provider for review. Oversampling did occur within the sample lists with regard to race, age, and sex to ensure recruitment of a cohort representative of the older adult population living within the recruitment catchment area. The providers received the screening sample by e-mail and were asked to respond within 1 week to corroborate eligibility. Study staff sent a reminder e-mail to nonresponding providers after 1 week. Participating practices were given posters and brochures to display in waiting areas so interested patients could contact study staff directly.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003ePotential participants approved for contact were sent either a single letter signed by the provider and the principal investigator (for MGH patients) or 2 letters signed separately by the provider and the principal investigator (for BWH patients).

Study staff also asked questions to determine the presence of major medical problems that would interfere with safe completion of the study protocol: significant visual impairment, uncontrolled hypertension, lower extremity amputation, supplemental oxygen use, and myocardial infarction or major surgery in the previous 6 months. Study participation was limited to English speakers because it was not feasible to translate the study instruments and conduct the interviews in the many other languages spoken in the Boston area.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eIndividuals who expressed interest in participating and met eligibility criteria were scheduled for the 2 baseline visits.

Researchers also excluded persons scoring less than 4 on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which indicated existing disability. To ensure a broad distribution of baseline physical functioning, researchers used the SPPB score to group prospective enrollees based on mobility performance.

An effort was made to evaluate all relevant attributes while also keeping subject burden manageable. During the first baseline visit, a nurse practitioner and a research assistant obtained informed consent and conducted the final eligibility screening. If the participant screened into the study, the nurse practitioner conducted the baseline visit, which generally required 2.5 hours including informed consent. This assessment included a physical examination, medical history, medication inventory, demographics, neuropsychological testing, and questionnaires on pain. The second baseline visit, which was conducted by a research assistant, took place within 2 weeks of the first visit and generally required 2 hours. This assessment included physical performance testing and questionnaires on functional ability, falls, rehabilitative care, and physical activity. Participants received $20 for each baseline visit. Transportation to both visits using commercial wheelchair-accessible vans was provided for all participants as needed. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 12 and 24 months at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Cambridge and used the same 2-visit structure. Between each set of visits, study staff contacted participants by phone every 3 months for a brief interview tracking falls, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and rehabilitative care.

The research involved the analysis of multiple datasets related to victims of bias- and non-bias-motivated assaults, and was intended to yield a spectrum of information on the victims\\' psychological and behavioral experiences and the patterns of prior criminal behavior by alleged offenders and victims. Data were collected on all 560 cases from the Boston Police Department\\'s Community Disorders Unit from 1992 to 1997 that involved a victim of a bias-motivated aggravated assault. In addition, data were collected on a 1-percent stratified random sample of victims of non-bias assaults within the city of Boston from 1993 to 1997, resulting in another 544 cases. For each of the cases, up to 49 items of information were collected from each police incident report. These included the victim\\'s date of birth, sex, and race, the name of the known offenders, and the date, time, location, and nature of the incident. Additionally, the researchers attempted to contact each victim in the sample to participate in a survey about their victimization experiences. Initial contact with each victim was made through an introductory letter sent to the home address recorded on the police report at the time of the incident. Approximately 50 percent of the introductory letters sent to the victim groups were returned as undeliverable by the United States Postal Service. The researchers then used an online computer service called Autotrak to locate probable current addresses for the undeliverable sample. A total of 441 (79 percent) of the surveys from the sample of 560 bias crime victims and 418 (77 percent) of the surveys from the sample of 544 non-bias-motivated assault victims appeared to be successfully delivered using these methods. Due to a low response rate, a random sample of 100 nonrespondents from each victim group was recontacted and offered a $15 incentive to complete the survey. These overall efforts yielded a final total of 91 completed surveys (21 percent) from the bias victim sample and 45 completed surveys (11 percent) from the non-bias victim sample. The victim questionnaires included open-ended, matrix, and contingency questions in five general categories: (1) incident information, (2) police response, (3) prosecutor response, (4) personal impact of the crime, and (5) respondent personal characteristics. Victims whose names appeared to be of Latino or Vietnamese origin were sent versions of the questionnaire in their native language as well as in English. Additional information was also obtained from criminal history records for identified offenders and victims in each case.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eThis study sought to inform various issues related to the extent of victims\\' adverse psychological and behavioral reactions to aggravated assault differentiated by the offenders\\' bias or non-bias motives. The goals of the research included (1) identifying the individual and situational factors related to bias- and non-bias-motivated aggravated assault, (2) determining the comparative severity and duration of psychological after-effects attributed to the victimization experience, and (3) measuring the comparative extent of behavioral avoidance strategies of victims.

Though violence is a significant aspect of the human experience, justifiable concerns have emerged and resulted in judicial and legislative decisions that impose more severe sanctions on offenders motivated by bias against their victims. These decisions are based on the assumption that bias-motivated crimes have a more debilitating effect on victims and a secondary impact on members within the affected groups. The opposing viewpoint is that all offenders who commit a specific type of crime should be sanctioned to a similar degree. Their motives should not be given prominence when imposing penalties. Such issues have been largely addressed using anecdotal information, with limited empirical data to confirm or disprove either assumption. This study sought to inform various issues related to the extent of victims\\' adverse psychological and behavioral reactions to aggravated assault differentiated by the offenders\\' bias or non-bias motives. The goals of the research included (1) identifying the individual and situational factors related to bias- and non-bias-motivated aggravated assault, (2) determining the comparative severity and duration of psychological after-effects attributed to the victimization experience, and (3) measuring the comparative extent of behavioral avoidance strategies of victims.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eDatasets:\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e \\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cul\\\\u003e \\\\n \\\\u003cli\\\\u003eDS1: Dataset\\\\u003c/li\\\\u003e \\\\n\\\\u003c/ul\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eResponse Rates: For the victim survey the response rate for bias assault victims was 21 percent and the response rate for non-bias assault victims was 11 percent.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eIncident data include the date, location, day, and time of the incident, type of bias motivation, the victims\\' age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and education, offenders\\' age, race, and gender, whether a weapon was used, and type of injuries sustained.

Six follow-ups were conducted, and information from death\\\\n certificates for deaths occurring in the first six years of follow-up\\\\n for all four sites was also collected. The data included in this\\\\n release of the EPESE make up the seventh follow-up and the fourth\\\\n in-person interview for the North Carolina site. This North Carolina\\\\n cohort, established in a 1986-1987 baseline survey, was a sample of\\\\n persons 65 or older residing in households in Durham, Warren,\\\\n Franklin, Granville, and Vance counties in the Central Piedmont area\\\\n of North Carolina. The North Carolina site was the only EPESE site in\\\\n the southeastern United States. This site was unique in that the\\\\n baseline cohort was over 50-percent Black, and the geographic area\\\\n selected was diverse, allowing both racial and urban/rural comparisons\\\\n to be made regarding the distribution of certain risk factors and\\\\n disease. The data cover demographic characteristics (age, sex, race,\\\\n income, education, marital status, number of children, employment, and\\\\n religion), height, weight, social and physical functioning, chronic\\\\n conditions, related health problems, health habits, self-reported use\\\\nof dental, hospital, and nursing home services, and depression.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],7,\"\\\\\"10.3886/ICPSR02744.v1\\\\\" OR \\\\\": Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, 1996-1997: Piedmont Health Survey of the Elderly, Fourth In-Person Survey [Durham, Warren, Vance, Granville, and Franklin Counties, North Carolina]\\\\\"\",\"http://prod.library.utoronto.ca:8090/datalib/codebooks/icpsr/2744/cb2744.pdf\",\"Data from: Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly,...\",\"Blazer, Dan G.;  George, Linda K.\"],\"5C0H0E47N4rWYu04AAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Associations between West-African and Native-American genetic ancestry and adiposity, stratified by gender and Healthy Eating Score.\"],[\"https://plos.figshare.com/articles/_Associations_between_West_African_and_Native_American_genetic_ancestry_and_adiposity_stratified_by_gender_and_Healthy_Eating_Score_/1376199/1\",\"plos.figshare.com\",,,\"figshare.com\"],,,,,,[\"BGA, association, body mass index, time.ConclusionFindings support, Ancestry Informative Markers, bmi, 7 years, biogeographic ancestry, pbf, Total Body Adiposity, whr, ci, Healthy Eating Scores, body adiposity, Boston Area Community Health Survey ObjectivesThe prevalence, Boston Area Community Health Survey.MethodsWe, 2.5 years, Uncategorised\"],,,,,[[\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"]],,,,,\"Apr 13, 2015\",\"Dec 3, 2015\",\"Apr 13, 2015\",\"10.1371/journal.pone.0122808.t005\",,,,[[\"PLOS\",\"https://www.plos.org/\",\"https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q\\\\u003dtbn:ANd9GcSbDDtFTMU1Wc2XjzyQyWZwRpQMBIa0gT_-IpKJoWspI0u98mfi\"]],,[[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eaModels additionally adjusted for age, income, education, healthy eating score (HE Score), physical activity, caloric intake, and occupation;\\\\nbmodels additionally adjusted for age, gender, income, education, physical activity, caloric intake, and occupation; CI \\\\u003d confidence interval; HE Score \\\\u003d Healthy Eating Score; int. \\\\u003d interaction; referent \\\\u003d European Ancestral Markers: percent change in BMI \\\\u003d 0.0000; WHR \\\\u003d 0.0000, PBF \\\\u003d 0.0000;\\\\n*significant at p\\\\u0026lt;0.005;\\\\n**significant at p\\\\u0026lt;0.0005.\\\\nAssociations between West-African and Native-American genetic ancestry and adiposity, stratified by gender and Healthy Eating Score.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],,,,\"Associations between West-African and Native-American genetic ancestry and...\",\"Sunali D.

Residents of ten communities were surveyed on a series of topics related to attendance at performing arts events. The ten communities surveyed were: Alaska, Cincinatti, Denver, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Austin, Boston, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Sarasota (FL) and Washington D.C. Questions were asked regarding rates of participation, the perceived value of the performing arts to individuals and to communities, and barriers to greater attendance. Among other criteria, these communities were selected as study sites because of the presence of financially and managerially strong local arts organizations and because at least three of the five disciplines encompassed by the participating national service organizations were represented in each area. The five participating service organizations in the PARC project were the American Symphony Orchestra League, the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, Dance/USA, OPERA America, and Theatre Communications Group.

The children of these mothers were re-contacted for follow-up by different researchers four times since the original study. These follow-ups are also available at the Murray Research Archive: Nowlis, 1963-1964 (Log# 00570), Crowne, Conn, Marlowe, and Edwards, 1965 (Log# 00572); Edwards, 1968 (Log# 00575); McClelland, 1978 (Log# 00046); and McClelland and Franz, 1987-1988 (Log# 01012).  McClelland and Franz interviewed the children from the original study at age 41. Participants were contacted for this wave by mail. Of the participants who could be located, 85% of the women and 66% of the men participated. The sample consisted of 89 participants who completed the mailed questionnaires. Seventy-three percent of the participants were also interviewed. The original participants were all White residents of two suburban towns near Boston in 1952. McClelland and Franz focused on predictors of four types of adjustment: Social and work accomplishment and psychological and physical health. Specifically, the Adult Life Patterns Project explored the effects of childhood, adolescent, and adult experiences on the kinds of lives adults lead and the effects of major life events, both positive and negative, on individual lives. The questionnaire asked about demographic information, parenting, education and employment, social life, recent life changes, and mental and physical health. Interviews included pictorial TATs, and open-ended questions about similar topics as those addressed in the questionnaire. Other questions asked about experiences of crime and trauma, and early life events. Those participants who were interviewed were asked to complete an additional questionnaire including a coping scale, sentence completions, a personal attitudes questionnaire, social attitudes rating, and a spouse questionnaire.

Trustee lists were either obtained from the organization itself, annual reports, or the IRS 990 forms. Once the trustee lists were acquired, the study team in each city began background research on the trustees in order to provide answers on the trustee code sheets. The project coordinator provided research teams in each city with codesheets indicating the information to be collected. Memoranda were sent to researchers with instructions as questions arose or coding procedures changed. The research teams collected biographical information on trustees through print sources, Nexis searches, and interviews. They completed the codesheets as thoroughly as possible given the information available. There is extensive missing data in this study due to factors such as a lack of adequate records from 1931 and uncooperative organizations. The trustee biographical study collected data on 8,927 individual trustees from 289 separate boards (approximately 15 organizations\\' boards for each of six cities over three different time periods).

Multiple questions asked respondents how Congress was handling their job, including whether they thought members of Congress were interested in serving the people they represent or special interest groups, and whether they had favorable opinions of the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress.  Opinions were also collected on the condition of the national economy, and which party respondents trusted to make the right decisions. Further questions asked respondents about their opinion of Islam, and whether they believed it encouraged violence. Respondents were also asked multiple questions about immigration, including whether terrorism has increased as a result of legal immigration, who they trusted more to make the right decisions concerning immigration, whether legal immigration should be increased, decreased, or stay the same, and whether respondents would vote for a candidate who does not share their view on immigration. Respondents were also asked multiple questions about the federal budget deficit including who they trusted more to make the right decisions, what effect it would have on the national economy, and how they would reduce the deficit. Additional topics included the budget sequestration, gun laws, the bombings at the Boston Marathon, and terrorism. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, marital status, education level, household income, religious preference, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, and whether respondents thought of themselves as born-again Christians.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]]],\"9Nq1/JR9iYuVASKkAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, Wave IV, 2000-2001 [Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas]\"],[\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/4314\",\"www.icpsr.umich.edu\",,,\"umich.edu\"],,,,,,[\"living arrangements\",\"mental health\",\"mortality rates\",\"older adults\",\"population characteristics\",\"quality of life\",\"life expectancy\",\"Hispanic or Latino Americans\",\"Mexican Americans\",\"demographic characteristics\",\"ethnicity\",\"health behavior\",\"health problems\",\"health status\"],,[\"sas\",\"stata\",\"spss\",\"delimited\",\"ascii\"],[[\"Texas\"],[\"United States of America\"],[\"California\"],[\"New Mexico\"],[\"Arizona\"]],,[[\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/4314/terms\"]],[[\"Markides, Kyriakos S., and Ray, Laura A.

Indeed, the oldest have outlived political regimes of all kinds. This stimulating historical and comparative study exemplifies the importance of in-depth experience and engagement with the cultural and structural environments in which some of the world’s greatest universities have over centuries incrementally developed and been embedded. This is crucial if we hope to understand the sources of their authority and myriad contributions to scientific knowledge and human flourishing. A neo-institutionalist scholar and multicultural citizen who fruitfully contributes to dialogues exploring core institutions in education and society on both sides of the Atlantic, Heinz-Dieter Meyer is uniquely placed to grapple with the complex processes of institutional learning and design that have made the German and American universities among the globally most productive. He also shows how they have influenced each other via the complex, yet crucial flows of inspired scholars and students carrying key idea(l)s with them for interpretation and application back home. The contributions of key actors, but also the outcomes of choices at critical junctures, such as the failure to establish a national state-funded university in the United States, take center stage in this engaging account of how the leaders of American universities adapted the German model, joining diverse concepts to design what has become the greatest uni-versity system in the world, yet one that remains nearly impossible to emulate due to the unique constellation of actors and institutional environment in which it developed.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cpre\\\\u003e\\\\u003ccode\\\\u003e        In eighteen chapters in four parts, The Design of the University: German, American, and “World Class” takes us from Göttingen and Berlin to Boston and to the world level as the scientific enterprise—and competition between scientists and the most crucial organizational form in which they conduct their experiments and make their arguments, the research university—becomes ever more global. Contributing to and inviting debate, Meyer’s main argument is that the American university has suc-ceeded based upon an institutional design—or, perhaps, a non-design—that on multiple levels facil-itates self-government and the identification of a niche within an extraordinarily large and differen-tiated higher education system. This is not a full-fledged historiographic treatment of a subject fa-vored by academics (permanently searching for reputational gains) and policymakers (as they in-creasingly launch research funding programs and evaluation systems to foster competition). Rather than a full-fledged sociology of science, this book creatively sketches the trajectories of German and American university development, emphasizing affinities as well as crucial differences, to ulti-mately argue that in fact “Humboldt’s most important ideas flourished in the American atmosphere of unrestricted institutional experimentation and vigorous self-government” (xiii). \\\\n\\\\n        Interrogating what he calls the “design thinking” of eminent thinkers Adam Smith and Wilhelm von Humboldt, among others, Meyer traces the challenging, complex, and contingent learning processes in the adaptation of the German research university model to the American context, eventually becoming the most differentiated and “world-class” higher education system in the world. Asking about the reasons for the American university’s success, especially in comparison to the recent insti-tutional crisis of the German research university, albeit still extraordinarily productive, Meyer argues that this American meritocratic success story has institutional design (of self-government) at its heart. Enjoying the patronage of not one, but three major institutions—state, church, and market—the American university attained true autonomy and global preeminence through unparalleled wealth of patronage and an intricate system of checks and balances. In this line of argument, chart-ing the ascendancy from humble origins of what can hardly be called a system due its extraordinary diversity, Meyer concurs with David Labaree (2017), who’s A Perfect Mess [1] is a highly-suitable com-panion piece grounded in the history of American higher education. Contemporary architects of higher education policy globally, driven by the fantasy of “world class” labels, Meyer warns, have completely underestimated the “institutional, social, and political prerequisites that excellence in research and teaching require” (p. 4).  \\\\n\\\\n        Meyer begins his treatise, appropriately, in Göttingen, the site of Georgia Augusta University, where many leaders of American higher education, first and foremost Boston Brahmin George Ticknor, learned by doing, ensconced in a cosmopolitan center of learning and intellectual enlightenment. The blueprint included professionalized scholarship, the unification of research and teaching in seminars and lectures, freedom to choose among academic offerings, a vast library of scientific knowledge, and academic standing based on perpetual production of cutting-edge research judged by peers (p. 19). Instead of Adam Smith’s preferred instruments of competition, choice, and tuition-dependence, Wilhelm von Humboldt’s “design revolution” proposed “three unities” whose powerful integration could surpass the utilitarian logic prevalent then and now: “teaching and research; scien-tific discovery and moral formation (Bildung); scholarly autonomy and scholarly community” (p. 40). \\\\n\\\\n        The book’s second part, on institutional learning, charts the institutional migration of the blueprint; the contested design options of Gymnasium, college, and graduate school (the latter ultimately the key to global preeminence); the lasting influence of Protestantism (here Meyer follows the arguments of Max Weber, Robert K. Merton, and Joseph Ben-David) and extraordinary educational philanthropy; the battle between those who would centralize, by establishing a national university, and those committed to local control; and finally the contrasting answers to the eternal question of vocational-ism—e.g., how should business be treated, as a sibling to medicine and law or as their distant cousin? The more education-enamored, democratically-inclined patrician elites of the American East Coast were, Meyer argues, radically different institution-builders than German scholars, French state nobility, or even Chinese mandarins: “No other class combined their respect for, and grand vision of, the civilizing role of learning with their economic resources and the realism needed to put their plans into practice” (p. 113). \\\\n\\\\n        Building on philosophical and historical elaboration, the book’s third part on achieving self-government discusses the six American moves leading to institutional innovation. At organizational level, the German chair and institute give way to departments and discipline, the university presi-dent is no longer figurehead but chief executive, and independent boards of trustees, not govern-ment officials, have ultimate authority. The implications for individuals and organizations of these “design shifts” cannot be overstated. Anyone seeking to understand American higher education, with its phenomenal vertical and horizontal differentiation and on-going academic drift (“a snake-like procession” as David Riesman, to whom the book is dedicated, calls it), and its self-organized autonomy—supported by many philanthropists without the limiting control of a few state bureau-crats—will find this analysis illuminating. Embedded in civil society, “vigorous self-government is the historic design contribution of the American university” (p. 209)—and an achievement that must be guarded in an era in which university autonomy is at risk. In concluding, Meyer’s American opti-mistic and laudatory tone shifts back to Germanic critique and foreboding, identifying challenges and the contemporary struggles that threaten the unintentional masterpiece of institutional learning and diversity. Such justified hopes and fears must now give way to empirical studies of the extraor-dinary outputs in terms of scientific production and societal capabilities and well-being brought about by the continuous process of university Bildung—in Germany, the United States, and around the world.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        [1] David Labaree (2017), A Perfect Mess: The Unlikely Ascendancy of American Higher Education. \\\\n        Chicago: University of Chicago Press.\\\\n\\\\u003c/code\\\\u003e\\\\u003c/pre\\\\u003e\"]],,,,\"Review of Meyer, Heinz-Dieter (2017): The Design of the University: German,...\",\"Justin J.

New Haven used a stratified random sample of clusters of households. The sample was stratified for three different types of residence: public housing for the elderly, private housing for the elderly, and elsewhere in the community. Males were oversampled to attempt to achieve balance in the sex distribution of the sample. In North Carolina area sampling was used at the first stage of the design to obtain a sample of 1980 census blocks, block clusters, and enumeration districts.

Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) The experimental group (also called the low-poverty voucher (LPV) group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location. (2) The Section 8 group (also called the traditional voucher (TRV) group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling. (3) The control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-98) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-10) with the purpose of determining the effects of \\\\\"neighborhood\\\\\" on participating families. This data collection contains data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation and are comprised of adult variables that have been analyzed. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the associated article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood leads to long-term (10- to 15-year) improvements in adult physical and mental health and subjective well-being, despite not affecting economic self-sufficiency.

Although patients with SD may be linked with specialty care and PC, their health care often remains episodic and fragmented, rather than longitudinal, comprehensive, integrated, and coordinated.  As a result, adults with SD often enter addiction treatment later and require acute medical care, rather than entering the system earlier when interventions of lower intensity but longer duration might prevent catastrophes.  Chronic disease management (CDM) is a collaborative, longitudinal approach to treatment of certain chronic medical illnesses proven to be more effective than routine care.  CDM addresses individual patient and health systems barriers to receipt of needed treatment.  However, the effectiveness of CDM for SD has not been tested.  The objective of this Addiction Health Evaluation and Disease management (AHEAD) study, was to test the effectiveness of CDM for SD in PC.Subject identification and recruitment occurred primarily at a local detoxification center, as well as by self and physician referral from the Boston Medical Center primary and ambulatory care clinics, emergency department, urgent care center, inpatient settings, and the community. The study enrolled 320 adults with drug dependence and 320 adults with alcohol dependence who were not in SD treatment, and randomized them to a SD CDM program (the AHEAD Clinic) integrated into a real-world PC clinic or to referral to standard PC.  All subjects were assessed regarding SD diagnosis, substance use and problems, readiness to change, health-related quality of life, and medical and drug treatment utilization.  Subjects were evaluated 3, 6, and 12 months later, and health services utilization data were collected for 2 years from a statewide database. Additionally, in order to better understand and explain the implementation and fidelity of the AHEAD Clinic, the primary care providers (PCPs) of AHEAD Clinic patients were surveyed. Each PCP was presented with a letter from the Principal Investigator explaining the purpose of the survey, the reason why s/he was being asked to complete the survey, compensation for completing the survey, and details about confidentiality and anonymity. The survey itself consisted of questions asking providers about their satisfaction and their attitudes towards caring for patients with alcohol and drug problems, their knowledge of services that the AHEAD Clinic provides, and their experience working with the AHEAD Clinic.\\\\nPrimary outcomes were illicit drug use, alcohol use, substance-related problems, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. The proposal\\'s hypothesis was that compared with standard care, a health services delivery intervention (CDM for SD integrated in PC) would decrease alcohol and illicit drug use and related problems, and improve health care utilization patterns.  Improved outcomes using the AHEAD approach would support the adoption of a health services delivery strategy, CDM, to better care for patients with SD.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eDataset 1: 844 variables; 563 cases; \\\\nDataset 2: 607 variables; 500 cases; \\\\nDataset 3: 607 variables; 487 cases; \\\\nDataset 4: 713 variables; 532 cases; \\\\nDataset 5: 80 variables; 549 cases; \\\\nDataset 6: 59 variables; 1,435 cases; \\\\nDataset 7: 25 variables; 87 cases; \\\\nDataset 8: 25 variables; 87 cases; \\\\nDataset 9: 41 variables; 73 cases; \\\\nDataset 10: 9 variables; 11,018 cases; \\\\nDataset 11: 5 variables; 511 cases;\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of \\\\n                disclosure.

Working directly with tissue banks, organ procurement agencies, medical examiners and the general public, this is the largest program dedicated to increasing and enhancing the availability of post-mortem brain tissue for basic research in autism. To date, the ATP has collected and stored more than 170 brains in their repositories at Harvard (US) and Oxford (UK). These brains are processed by formalin fixation and/or snap frozen to properly provide high quality tissue of all brain regions, in support of biological research in autism. The ATP is unique in that they diligently pursue all available clinical data (pre and post mortem) on tissue donors in order to create the most biologically relevant brain repository for autism research. These data, together with tissue resources from both banks and associated repositories, are presented to all interested researchers through their extensive web-based data portal (login required). The ATP is not a brain bank, but works directly with the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center in Boston (HBTRC), Massachusetts to serve as its tissue repository. This program augments brain bank functions by: * Creating the most biologically relevant brain tissue repository possible * Fully covering all costs associated with brain extraction and transfer to the repositories at Harvard (US and Canada) and Oxford (UK). * Providing scientific oversight of tissue distributions * Overseeing and managing all tissue grants * Clinically phenotyping and acquiring extensive medical data on all of their donors * Providing continuing family support and communication to all of their donors * Directly supporting researchers to facilitate autism research * Maintaining a robust web based data management and secure on-line global interface system * Developing and supporting ATP established scientific initiatives * Actively providing public outreach and education The ATP is not a clinical organ procurement agency, but rather they facilitate the wishes of donors and families to donate their tissue to autism research. Through the ATP\\'s established international infrastructure, they work with any accredited tissue bank, organ procurement agency, or medical examiner that receives a family\\'s request to donate their loved one\\'s tissue to the program. Once contacted, the ATP will insure that the family\\'s request to donate their loved one\\'s tissue is faithfully met, covering all costs to the family and partnering agency as well as ensuring the tissues\\' proper and rapid transport to the ATP\\'s repository at the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC) in Boston, Massachusetts.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],345,\"\\\\\"Autism Tissue Program\\\\\"\"],\"LS23aK6VbeNNdBWjAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Archival Version\"],[\"http://www.da-ra.de/dara/study/web_show?res_id\\\\u003d645538\\\\u0026lang\\\\u003den\\\\u0026mdlang\\\\u003den\\\\u0026detail\\\\u003dtrue\",\"www.da-ra.de\",,,\"da-ra.de\"],[[\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ADDEP/studies/37045\",\"www.icpsr.umich.edu\",,,\"umich.edu\"]],[\"Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE), 2009-2014\"],,,,[\"primary care\",\"health\",\"health status\",\"injuries\",\"medications\",\"older adults\",\"physical disabilities\",\"rehabilitation\"],,,,,,,,\"2009\",\"2014\",\"May 31, 2018\",,,\"10.3886/ICPSR37045\",,,[[\"United States Department of Health and Human Services\",\"https://www.hhs.gov/\",\"https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q\\\\u003dtbn:ANd9GcTH4XjWZXvM_DELiU8D6Z8F2Os2G-Lvqqc37Y6BnYBpLV1q1HWj\"],[\"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\",\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/\",\"https://t3.gstatic.com/images?q\\\\u003dtbn:ANd9GcQVnQhPvGNb-YT10veGwf8LoymQ5nSiLplIssFa9PkItJfLf04N\"],[\"National Center for Research Resources\",,\"https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q\\\\u003dtbn:ANd9GcSECTNi8svi5zteXY8XxMr1Tsrb8KYDizzJA8doeazWQ855y565\"]],[[\"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research\",\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/\",\"https://t2.gstatic.com/images?q\\\\u003dtbn:ANd9GcQPPjY5m-WMirZSmPMkyd5Q0DI_6QBG4X6voYVv1UTW1rHFA68-\"],[\"da|ra\"]],,[[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eThe study visits were designed to collect extensive information on medical and rehabilitative impairments according to the aims of the study.

During the first baseline visit, a nurse practitioner and a research assistant obtained informed consent and conducted the final eligibility screening. If the participant screened into the study, the nurse practitioner conducted the baseline visit, which generally required 2.5 hours including informed consent. This assessment included a physical examination, medical history, medication inventory, demographics, neuropsychological testing, and questionnaires on pain. The second baseline visit, which was conducted by a research assistant, took place within 2 weeks of the first visit and generally required 2 hours. This assessment included physical performance testing and questionnaires on functional ability, falls, rehabilitative care, and physical activity. Participants received $20 for each baseline visit. Transportation to both visits using commercial wheelchair-accessible vans was provided for all participants as needed. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 12 and 24 months at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Cambridge and used the same 2-visit structure. Between each set of visits, study staff contacted participants by phone every 3 months for a brief interview tracking falls, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and rehabilitative care.

Study staff used the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) to generate primary care provider specific lists of patients meeting the preliminary eligibility criteria. The RPDR is a centralized clinical data registry housing clinical information from Partners HealthCare facilities. Patients meeting the preliminary inclusion criteria within a provider\\'s panel were randomly selected for inclusion on the recruitment master list. The master list was divided into subgroups based on sex, age, and race, and sorted into a random order to ensure random selection from each subgroup. Screening samples of 50 to 100 patients were created and sent to each provider for review. Oversampling did occur within the sample lists with regard to race, age, and sex to ensure recruitment of a cohort representative of the older adult population living within the recruitment catchment area. The providers received the screening sample by e-mail and were asked to respond within 1 week to corroborate eligibility. Study staff sent a reminder e-mail to nonresponding providers after 1 week.

The study included surveys of randomly selected samples of male and female students attending two large universities in the Boston area. The first (University 1) is a prestigious and highly selective institution; the student body of the second (University 2) is more heterogeneous. The data were collected at University 1 in 1982 and at University 2 in 1984.  Questionnaires were distributed to 1200 students (800 women and 400 men) at each school. The survey instrument contained questions on demographic and family background, social relationships, athletic activities, academic performance, weight and dieting history, general eating patterns and attitudes, drug consumption (including alcohol and caffeine), family health history, and bulimic and related symptomatology. The response rates were 76% at University 1 (N \\\\u003d 908) and 53% at University 2 (N \\\\u003d 633). In both groups, three-quarters of the respondents were female. A follow-up questionnaire was distributed to all bulimic women and a matched subsample of normal eaters at University 2. In-depth individual interviews designed to explore in detail eating attitudes and behaviors were also conducted with 32 bulimic and non-bulimic participants.   The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (questionnaires, transcripts of the interviews have been digitized and are available for access on-line).

One year after the first interview, the women who had experienced abuse were re-interviewed to determine whether their circumstances had changed and why they had or had not changed. For both interviews, data were collected on contacts with the justice system and satisfaction with those contacts. To measure abuse and one-year outcomes, variables included: values/norms promoting husband\\'s domination, conflict over expectations about gender roles and other aspects of family life, immigration (reasons for immigration, sequencing of husband\\'s and wife\\'s move, each person\\'s legal status), and circumstances related to immigration (discrimination, employment and occupational status, proximity of extended family, wife\\'s support network). Qualitative data on the pattern, nature, and context of the abuse was collected to provide description of why the abuse occurred, and to support findings from the quantitative analysis and/or better specify the causative model. Additional variables included wife\\'s perceptions of immigration law and the outcome of criminal justice involvement; wife\\'s perception of the consequences of divorce (financial, legal realities and cultural norms regarding child custody, effect of marital status on woman\\'s social status and quality of life); need for and effects of wife moving from the ethnic community to the mainstream to escape abuse (need of identification with the ethnic group, support network of relatives and friends, social reactions to abuse); wife\\'s economic power (ability to speak English, earn a living); wife\\'s experience in seeking help (knowledge of United States legal system, availability of legal and victim assistance for abused women, experience with the justice system and victim assistance programs).

Each week, agency employees searched departmental records and extracted the names and addresses of persons who had a recent contact with a police officer because of a reported crime incident, a reported traffic accident or traffic stop. These individuals were then sent a letter from the chief of police encouraging them to complete a short survey evaluating the encounter.Data for the survey of police recruits (Longitudinal Study of Recruits Data) were collected from 1,072 new officers drawn from four large departments in four states and many smaller departments in a fifth state.

Phase I focused on testing methods and measures in 29 agencies in order to build the Platform infrastructure. First, a \\\\\"total department\\\\\" online methodology was successfully implemented covering numerous dimensions of organizational behavior, from supervision and accountability to employee integrity and burnout. Second, a public satisfaction contact survey was implemented in several jurisdictions to provide local external indicators of the quality of police-citizen encounters and organizational legitimacy in the community. Third, two longitudinal studies were initiated - one of new police recruits and one of new first-line supervisors - to chart their career development and identify factors that influence life trajectories.

The 29 participating agencies included municipal police departments, county police, county sheriff\\'s and one tribal agency. Administration of the surveys was coordinated with agency representatives, and the e-mail invitations to participate were sent to all employees by the departments\\' senior leaders. The initial email, and subsequent reminder messages, included a link to the survey site. The home page for each survey described the project\\'s potential risks and benefits; respondents who chose to participate were next presented the questions. Each survey took an average of about ten minutes to complete. Separate questions were presented to sworn and civilian respondents, based on their answers to an early question about their job status.The project involved eleven topical modules:Accountability (Accountability Data, n\\\\u003d2,146); Communication and Innovation (Communication and Innovation Data, n\\\\u003d1,508); Culture (Culture Data, n\\\\u003d1,363); Fairness (Fairness Data, n\\\\u003d778); Health and Stress (Stress and Health Satisfaction Data, n\\\\u003d2,594); Leadership and Supervision (Leadership Data, n\\\\u003d1,859); Police and Community (Police and Community Data, n\\\\u003d1,785); Structure, Unions and Priorities (Priorities Data, n\\\\u003d2,499); Technology (Technology Data, n\\\\u003d1,769); Training (Training Data, n\\\\u003d1,346); and; Omnibus (Omnibus A Data, n\\\\u003d1,139 and Omnibus B Data, n\\\\u003d1,705); In all but the largest agencies, everyone in an agency received the same questionnaire, and those agencies were surveyed two to four times during the course of a year on different topics. In agencies with more than 1,500 sworn members, different surveys were sent to randomly selected subsets of employees. Not all agencies were surveyed on all topics and no survey has respondents from all 29 agencies.The Public Satisfaction Survey (Public Satisfaction Survey Data, n\\\\u003d1,290) was developed to provide a key set of external indicators of organizational performance. The survey was field tested for 10 months in three cities, Oak Park, Illinois, River Forest, Illinois, and Boston, Massachusetts. Each week, agency employees searched departmental records and extracted the names and addresses of persons who had a recent contact with a police officer because of a reported crime incident, a reported traffic accident or traffic stop. These individuals were then sent a letter from the chief of police encouraging them to complete a short survey evaluating the encounter. Respondents were offered the option to reply to the survey either through an automated telephone survey or by going online and taking a web survey.Researchers developed and implemented a longitudinal study of the life course of new officers, beginning during their first week at the training academy (Longitudinal Study of Recruits Data, n\\\\u003d1,072). The study followed more than 1,000 recruits in Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, and multiple smaller agencies in Kentucky. Several data collection strategies were used to gather information on new officers. For all officers, these included paper and pencil surveys and online surveys. For some classes, data were supplemented by one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and videotaped role playing. Online surveys were offered via email invitation while officers were in the training academy and after they had graduated. Contact emails were sent on the first of each month and reminder emails were sent each week to individuals who had not yet taken each survey. There were a total of seven in-academy online surveys and a total of ten post-academy online surveys. Because the post-academy online survey response rates were low, two classes were administered in-person questionnaires when they were brought back to the training academy for in-service training after 30 and 60 days in the field.Five police agencies, four large and one small, participated in a longitudinal study of first-line supervisors, along with one statewide training center. The study tracked newly designated first-line supervisors, starting at the beginning of the basic supervisory training (Longitudinal Study of Supervisors Data, n\\\\u003d463). Individuals who agreed to participate took two surveys during the early part of their training and a third soon after their training was completed. Participants were then sent short monthly surveys. Survey administration varied by study site. Researchers completed in-depth interviews with police chiefs from 24 local police agencies (Senior Executive Survey Data, n\\\\u003d24), most in person and a few by telephone. The interviews varied in length from an hour to more than two hours. Several respondents provided researchers with copies of their resumes and other written material. Interviewers took handwritten notes and transcribed them soon after completion of the interview. After all of the interview transcripts were completed, they were reviewed by the author, and some of the responses were coded into categories.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eThe National Police Research Platform was designed to a) strengthen the science of policing by generating timely, in-depth, longitudinal information about policing organizations, personnel and practices and, b) move policing in the direction of evidence-based \\\\\"learning organizations\\\\\" by providing translational feedback to police agencies and policy makers.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],,,,,\"McDevitt, Jack (Northeastern University);  Hartnett, Susan (University of Illinois at Chicago);  Rosenbaum, Dennis (University of Illinois at Chicago);  Fridell, Lorie (University of South Florida);  Skogan, Wesley (Northwestern University);  Cordner, Gary (Kutztown University);  Mastrofski, Stephen (George Mason University)\"],\"5evMvLBmaJ4eLxNkAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Public Use Data (2008-10) on Neighborhood Effects on Obesity and Diabetes Among Low-Income Adults from the All Five Sites of the Moving to Opportunity Experiment\"],[\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34974\",\"www.icpsr.umich.edu\",,,\"umich.edu\"],[[\"http://www.da-ra.de/dara/study/web_show?res_id\\\\u003d451063\\\\u0026lang\\\\u003dde\\\\u0026mdlang\\\\u003dde\\\\u0026detail\\\\u003dtrue\",\"www.da-ra.de\",,,\"da-ra.de\"],[\"https://search.datacite.org/works/10.3886/ICPSR34974\",\"search.datacite.org\",,,\"datacite.org\"],[\"https://www.researchconnections.org/childcare/studies/34974\",\"www.researchconnections.org\",,,\"researchconnections.org\"]],,,,,[\"physical condition\",\"poverty programs\",\"public housing\",\"quality of life\",\"poverty\",\"obesity\",\"diabetes\",\"living conditions\",\"neighborhood characteristics\",\"neighborhood conditions\",\"neighborhoods\"],,,[[\"Los Angeles\"],[\"Illinois\"],[\"Chicago\"],[\"New York City\"],[\"Massachusetts\"],[\"United States of America\"],[\"New York\"],[\"Baltimore\"],[\"Boston\"],[\"Maryland\"],[\"California\"]],,[[\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34974/terms\"]],[[\"Ludwig, Jens, Sanbonmatsu, Lisa, McDade, Thomas W., Gennetian, Lisa A., Adam, Emma, Duncan, Greg J., … Whitaker, Robert C.

Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) the low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location; (2) the traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling; (3) the control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of \\\\\"neighborhood\\\\\" on participating families. This data collection includes data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the associated article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood was associated in the long-term (10 to 15 years) with modest, but potentially important, reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The data contain all outcomes and mediators analyzed for the associated article (with the exception of a few mediator variables from the interim MTO evaluation) as well as a variety of demographic and other baseline measures that were controlled for in the analysis.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],,,,\"Public Use Data (2008-10) on Neighborhood Effects on Obesity and Diabetes...\",\"Ludwig, Jens;  Whitaker, Robert C.;  McDade, Thomas W.;  Sanbonmatsu, Lisa;  Gennetian, Lisa A.;  Adam, Emma;  Duncan, Greg J.;  Katz, Lawrence F.;  Kessler, Ronald C.;  Kling, Jeffrey R.;  Tessler Lindau, Stacy\"],\"92TNjygtVLm6T7onAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Data from: Associations between Prenatal Exposure to Black Carbon and Memory Domains in Urban Children: Modification by Sex and Prenatal Stress\"],[\"https://plos.figshare.com/articles/_Associations_between_Prenatal_Exposure_to_Black_Carbon_and_Memory_Domains_in_Urban_Children_Modification_by_Sex_and_Prenatal_Stress_/1596714\",\"plos.figshare.com\",,,\"figshare.com\"],,,,,,[\"association, Wide Range Assessment, Massachusetts pregnancy cohort, carbon exposure, WRAML 2 index scores, age 6 years, General Memory Index, Prenatal Stress BackgroundWhether, Black carbon exposure, Attention Concentration Index scores, stress, WRAML 2 index, Uncategorised\"],,,,,[[\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"]],,,,,\"Nov 6, 2015\",\"Dec 3, 2015\",\"Nov 6, 2015\",\"10.1371/journal.pone.0142492\",,,,[[\"PLOS\",\"https://www.plos.org/\",\"https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q\\\\u003dtbn:ANd9GcSbDDtFTMU1Wc2XjzyQyWZwRpQMBIa0gT_-IpKJoWspI0u98mfi\"]],,[[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eBackground\\\\nWhether fetal neurodevelopment is disrupted by traffic-related air pollution is uncertain. Animal studies suggest that chemical and non-chemical stressors interact to impact neurodevelopment, and that this association is further modified by sex.\\\\nObjectives\\\\nTo examine associations between prenatal traffic-related black carbon exposure, prenatal stress, and sex with children’s memory and learning.\\\\nMethods\\\\nAnalyses included N \\\\u003d 258 mother-child dyads enrolled in a Boston, Massachusetts pregnancy cohort. Black carbon exposure was estimated using a validated spatiotemporal land-use regression model. Prenatal stress was measured using the Crisis in Family Systems-Revised survey of negative life events. The Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML2) was administered at age 6 years; outcomes included the General Memory Index and its component indices [Verbal, Visual, and Attention Concentration]. Relationships between black carbon and WRAML2 index scores were examined using multivariable-adjusted linear regression including effect modification by stress and sex.\\\\nResults\\\\nMothers were primarily minorities (60% Hispanic, 26% Black); 67% had ≤12 years of education. The main effect for black carbon was not significant for any WRAML2 index; however, in stratified analyses, among boys with high exposure to prenatal stress, Attention Concentration Index scores were on average 9.5 points lower for those with high compared to low prenatal black carbon exposure (P3-way interaction \\\\u003d 0.04).\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThe associations between prenatal exposure to black carbon and stress with children’s memory scores were stronger in boys than in girls.

Around 2000, the faculty at Boston University’s Metropolitan College proposed an online master’s degree in project management, using the emerging learning management systems. The program grew quickly from 40 to 200 students, and was one of the first in the United States to be accredited by the Project Management Institute’s Global Accreditation Committee. This academic model has now been extended to other disciplines and programs.It was expected from the outset that the BU online and classroom academic experiences would be completely equivalent. This presented several challenges, the first of which was developing online equivalents for the face-to-face pedagogical course components. Second, writing online courses, recording videos and developing innovative discussion topics is time-consuming, and we quickly realised that only fulltime faculty had the commitment and motivation to devote the required effort to produce quality courses. Finally, the technological resources associated with course development and course operation required significant investment, beyond the faculty time, currently estimated at around $60,000 per course.We surveyed our students and alumni every two years and now have enough data to describe accurately the evolution in attitudes to online education.As one of the earlier and premier adopters of a rigorous academic online education model, BU has a vested interest to contribute to the growing debate about the academic quality and rigour of online education, the application of high pedagogical standards, and the innovative use of online teaching frameworks and tools. This paper will address and document these issues and assist in raising awareness of emerging “best practice” in the online education domain.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],2,\"\\\\\"10.5130/pppm.v2i2.2231\\\\\" OR \\\\\"Developing and teaching of a world-class online project management curriculum\\\\\"\",,\"Developing and teaching of a world-class online project management...\",\"Stephen A.

These parameters came from a special analysis of the March 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) that included all households in the continental United States that had a telephone. The city samples were also weighted to match parameters based on 2000 Census of the Population and Housing. A final adjustment was made to the city sample weight to put all the cities in their proper proportions relative to one another. Weighting was accomplished using Sample Balancing, a special iterative sample weighting program that simultaneously balances the distributions of all variables using a statistical technique called the Deming Algorithm. Finally, weights were trimmed to prevent individual interviews from having too much influence on the final results. The use of these weights in statistical analysis ensures that the demographic characteristics of the sample closely approximate the demographic characteristics of the population. Each dataset contains weight variables: NATWT is to be used to weight the national sample. CITYWT is used to weight individual city samples. WEIGHT or WGHTALL is used when you need to combine any of the samples, e.g., to run data tabulations that include both the national and city samples.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eThis data collection contains variables about background on arts attitudes, personal contact with and perceptions of artists, participation in arts activities, support for artists, weights, and administrative and demographic information.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"],[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eResponse Rates: For each sample, the response rate was calculated by taking the product of three component rates: contact rate -- the proportion of working numbers where a request for interview was made; cooperation rate -- the proportion of contacted numbers where a consent for interview was at least initially obtained and; completion rate -- the proportion of initially cooperating and eligible interviews that were completed. The rate formula used by PSRAI is consistent with the American Association for Public Opinion Research standards. The response rate for the national survey was 37.1 percent.

We advance open-source software infrastructure to support scientific investigation and data-driven decision making with a data sharing system using a water quality assessment developed to investigate post-Hurricane Maria drinking water contamination in Puerto Rico. One limitation to effective disaster response is easy and rapid access to diverse information about available resources and maps of community resource needs and risks.  Research products are made Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) using a collaborative, online sharing platform – HydroShare.   Curating a central repository of assembled research data has the potential to greatly facilitate coordinated disaster responses of all types, with opportunities to improve planning, preparedness, and monitoring of the recovery process.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],,,,\"Building research software infrastructure to prevent disasters like...\",\"Christina Bandaragoda;  Miguel Leon;  Jimmy Phuong\"],\"NhQGGvMu00d4itVFAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"ABC News Vatican Meeting - Expectations Poll, 2002\"],[\"http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/ABCVAT02.asp\",\"www.thearda.com\",,,\"thearda.com\"],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"2002\",,,,[[\"ABC News\"]],[[\"Association of Religion Data Archives\",\"http://www.thearda.com/\",\"https://t3.gstatic.com/images?q\\\\u003dtbn:ANd9GcRftZgr7Srt_75pSBluIraFU6r_l5jhTVz_pBryIWA_hODqv-4L\"]],,[[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003eIn this April 2002 ABC News/Washington Post poll, a random national sample of 1,207 Americans was asked first about their views on the current Middle East crisis and then about the Catholic Church\\'s handling of the issue of priests and child sexual abuse.

More specifically, it seeks to\\\\ndefine the social and psychological characteristics and aspirations of\\\\nthe Black and White urban populations. Samples of Blacks and Whites\\\\nwere selected in each of the cities in early 1968. The study employed\\\\ntwo questionnaire forms, one for Whites and one for Blacks, and two\\\\ncorresponding data files were generated. Attitudinal questions asked\\\\nof the White and Black respondents measured their satisfaction with\\\\ncommunity services, their feelings about the effectiveness of\\\\ngovernment in solving urban problems, and their experience with police\\\\nabuse. Additional questions about the respondent\\'s familiarity with\\\\nand participation in antipoverty programs were included. Other\\\\nquestions centered on the respondent\\'s opinions about the 1967 riots:\\\\nthe main causes, the purpose, the major participating classes, and the\\\\neffect of the riots on the Black cause. Respondents\\' interracial\\\\nrelationships, their attitudes toward integration, and their\\\\nperceptions of the hostility between the races were also\\\\ninvestigated. White respondents were asked about their opinions on the\\\\nuse of governmental intervention as a solution for various problems of\\\\nthe Blacks, such as substandard schools, unemployment, and unfair\\\\nhousing practices. Respondent\\'s reactions to nonviolent and violent\\\\nprotests by Blacks, their acceptance of counter-rioting by Whites and\\\\ntheir ideas concerning possible governmental action to prevent further\\\\nrioting were elicited. Inquiries were made as to whether or not the\\\\nrespondent had given money to support or hinder the Black cause. Other\\\\nitems investigated respondents\\' perceptions of racial discrimination\\\\nin jobs, education, and housing, and their reactions to working under\\\\nor living next door to a Black person. Black respondents were asked\\\\nabout their perceptions of discrimination in hiring, promotion, and\\\\nhousing, and general attitudes toward themselves and towards Blacks in\\\\ngeneral. The survey also investigated respondents\\' past participation\\\\nin civil rights organizations and in nonviolent and/or violent\\\\nprotests, their sympathy with rioters, and the likelihood of personal\\\\nparticipation in a future riot. Other questions probed respondents\\'\\\\nattitudes toward various civil rights leaders along with their\\\\nconcurrence with statements concerning the meaning of \\\\\"Black power.\\\\\"\\\\nDemographic variables include sex and age of the respondent, and the\\\\nage and relationship to the respondent of each person in the\\\\nhousehold, as well as information about the number of persons in the\\\\nhousehold, their race, and the type of structure in which they\\\\nlived. Additional demographic topics include the occupational and\\\\neducational background of the respondent, of the respondent\\'s family\\\\nhead, and of the respondent\\'s father. The respondent\\'s family income\\\\nand the amount of that income earned by the head of the family were\\\\nobtained, and it was determined if any of the family income came from\\\\nwelfare, Social Security, or veteran\\'s benefits. This study also\\\\nascertained the place of birth of the respondent and respondent\\'s\\\\nmother and father, in order to measure the degree of southern\\\\ninfluence. Other questions investigated the respondent\\'s military\\\\nbackground, religious preference, marital status, and family\\\\ncomposition.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\"]],16,\"\\\\\"10.3886/ICPSR03500.v2\\\\\" OR \\\\\"Racial Attitudes in Fifteen American Cities, 1968\\\\\"\",,,\"Campbell, Angus;  Schuman, Howard\"],\"1h5xIyxjlEFin35jAAAAAA\\\\u003d\\\\u003d\"],[,,[,[\"Alternate Route\"],[\"https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/89044dbd4e7a4ec288d18b2b477237d4_1\",\"hub.arcgis.com\",,,\"arcgis.com\"],,,,,,[\"Railways\",\"Education; Railways; Rail; Canadian Pacific Railway; CPR\",\"Education\",\"ESRI Canada\",\"Canadian Pacific Railway\",\"Canada\",\"CPR\",\"ArcCanada\"],,,,,[[\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5\"]],,,,,\"1325689008000\",,,,,,,,,[[,\"\\\\u003cp class\\\\u003d\\\\\"boqResearchsciencesearchdesktopuiDetailDescriptionElement_\\\\\"\\\\u003e\\\\u003cspan\\\\u003eThis time-enabled map service depicts the growth of the Canadian Railroad between 1835 and 1995,.

              " \"\\\\u003eThe Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality was designed to\\\\nbroaden the understanding of how changing labor market dynamics,\\\\nracial attitudes and stereotypes, and racial residential segregation\\\\nact singly and in concert to foster contemporary urban\\\\ninequality. This data collection comprises data for two surveys: a\\\\nsurvey of households and a survey of employers. Multistage area\\\\nprobability sampling of adult residents took place in four\\\\nmetropolitan areas: Atlanta (April 1992-September 1992), Boston (May\\\\n1993-November 1994), Detroit (April-September 1992), and Los Angeles\\\\n(September 1993-August 1994). The combined four-city data file in Part\\\\n1 contains data on survey questions that were asked in households in\\\\nat least two of the four survey cities. Questions on labor market\\\\ndynamics included industry, hours worked per week, length of time on\\\\njob, earnings before taxes, size of employer, benefits provided,\\\\ninstances of harassment and discrimination, and searching for work\\\\nwithin particular areas of the metropolis in which the respondent\\\\nresided. Questions covering racial attitudes and attitudes about\\\\ninequality centered on the attitudes and beliefs that whites, Blacks,\\\\nLatinos, and Asians hold about one another, including amount of\\\\ndiscrimination, perceptions about wealth and intelligence, ability to\\\\nbe self-supporting, ability to speak English, involvement with drugs\\\\nand gangs, the fairness of job training and educational assistance\\\\npolicies, and the fairness of hiring and promotion\\\\npreferences. Residential segregation issues were studied through\\\\nmeasures of neighborhood quality and satisfaction, and preferences\\\\nregarding the racial/ethnic mix of neighborhoods. Other topics\\\\nincluded residence and housing, neighborhood characteristics, family\\\\nincome structure, networks and social functioning, and interviewer\\\\nobservations. Demographic information on household respondents was\\\\nalso elicited, including length of residence, education, housing\\\\nstatus, monthly rent or mortgage payment, marital status, gender, age,\\\\nrace, household composition, citizenship status, language spoken in\\\\nthe home, ability to read and speak English, political affiliation,\\\\nand religion. The data in Part 2 represent a telephone survey of\\\\ncurrent business establishments in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los\\\\nAngeles carried out between spring 1992 and spring 1995 to learn about\\\\nhiring and vacancies, particularly for jobs requiring just a high\\\\nschool education. An employer size-weighted, stratified, probability\\\\nsample (approximately two-thirds of the cases) was drawn from regional\\\\nemployment directories, and a probability sample (the other third of\\\\nthe cases) was drawn from the current or most recent employer reported\\\\nby respondents to the household survey in Part 1. Employers were\\\\nqueried about characteristics of their firms, including composition of\\\\nthe firm's labor force, vacant positions, the person most recently\\\\nhired and his or her salary, hours worked per week, educational\\\\nqualifications, promotions, the firm's recruiting and hiring methods,\\\\nand demographic information for the respondent, job applicants, the\\\\nfirm's customers, and the firm's labor force, including age,\\\\neducation, race, and gender.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

Pairs of computer-randomized resumes were sent to employers in these two cities.  Response rates were measured by age, as indicated on each resume by date of high school graduation.  Applicants' working history, job choice, certifications, volunteer experience as well as their education and age have been evaluated in this study. Other questions focused on job advertisement and interviewing process.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

The data collection was divided into six discrete projects centered around each of the cities of interest: Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Each research team was responsible for identifying the 15 organizations in their city that fit the criteria of largest 501(c)(3): secular hospital, Protestant hospital, Catholic hospital, Jewish hospital, art museum, symphony orchestra, United Way, institution of higher education, Junior League, community foundation, YMCA, YWCA, secular family services, Catholic family services, and Jewish family services. The process resulted in a board-level data set of about ninety organizations that would be directly comparable across cities; researchers then collected demographic information on the trustees of each organization during the years 1931, 1961, and 1991. Researchers collected data on 8,926 individual trustees from 289 separate boards (approximately 15 organizations' boards for each of six cities over three different time periods). The data set archived at the Cultural Policy and the Arts National Data Archive (CPANDA) was missing data for 22 entire boards (see Collection Note 2).\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

              " \"\\\\u003eThe Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality was designed to broaden the understanding of how changing labor market dynamics, racial attitudes and stereotypes, and racial residential segregation act singly and in concert to foster contemporary urban inequality. This data collection comprises data for two surveys: a survey of households and a survey of employers. Multistage area probability sampling of adult residents took place in four metropolitan areas: Atlanta (April 1992-September 1992), Boston (May 1993-November 1994), Detroit (April-September 1992), and Los Angeles (September 1993-August 1994). The combined four-city data file in Part 1 contains data on survey questions that were asked in households in at least two of the four survey cities. Questions on labor market dynamics included industry, hours worked per week, length of time on job, earnings before taxes, size of employer, benefits provided, instances of harassment and discrimination, and searching for work within particular areas of the metropolis in which the respondent resided. Questions covering racial attitudes and attitudes about inequality centered on the attitudes and beliefs that whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians hold about one another, including amount of discrimination, perceptions about wealth and intelligence, ability to be self-supporting, ability to speak English, involvement with drugs and gangs, the fairness of job training and educational assistance policies, and the fairness of hiring and promotion preferences. Residential segregation issues were studied through measures of neighborhood quality and satisfaction, and preferences regarding the racial/ethnic mix of neighborhoods. Other topics included residence and housing, neighborhood characteristics, family income structure, networks and social functioning, and interviewer observations. Demographic information on household respondents was also elicited, including length of residence, education, housing status, monthly rent or mortgage payment, marital status, gender, age, race, household composition, citizenship status, language spoken in the home, ability to read and speak English, political affiliation, and religion. The data in Part 2 represent a telephone survey of current business establishments in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles carried out between spring 1992 and spring 1995 to learn about hiring and vacancies, particularly for jobs requiring just a high school education. An employer size-weighted, stratified, probability sample (approximately two-thirds of the cases) was drawn from regional employment directories, and a probability sample (the other third of the cases) was drawn from the current or most recent employer reported by respondents to the household survey in Part 1. Employers were queried about characteristics of their firms, including composition of the firm's labor force, vacant positions, the person most recently hired and his or her salary, hours worked per week, educational qualifications, promotions, the firm's recruiting and hiring methods, and demographic information for the respondent, job applicants, the firm's customers, and the firm's labor force, including age, education, race, and gender.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

              " '\\\\u003eMoving to Opportunity (MTO) was designed to answer questions about what happens when very poor families have the chance to move out of subsidized housing in the poorest neighborhoods of five very large American cities. MTO was a demonstration program: its approach combined tenant-based housing vouchers with location restrictions and housing counseling. MTO was also a randomized social experiment, carefully designed and rigorously implemented to test the effects of this approach on participating families. The interim evaluation included the collection of data on a wide range of outcomes that could potentially be affected by the MTO intervention. These outcomes fit into 6 study domains: (1) mobility, housing, and neighborhood, (2) adult and child physical and mental health, (3) child educational achievement, (4) youth delinquency and risky behavior, (5) adult and youth employment and earnings, and (6) household income and public assistance receipt. The restricted access data being made available through ICPSR includes many such analytic variables constructed from surveys and administrative data. The Tier 1 data also includes a census tract ID that allows researchers to link other neighborhood-level data.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e',\n",

The project investigates the strategies families have used to respond to reform, in terms of employment, schooling or other forms of training, residential mobility, and fertility. Central to this project is a focus on how these strategies affect children's lives, with an emphasis on their health and development as well as their need for, and use of, social services. For the first wave of the study, between March 1999 and December 1999, a random sample of approximately 2,400 households with children in low-income neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio were selected for interviews. Forty percent of the families interviewed were receiving cash welfare payments at the time of the interview. Each household had a child aged 0 to 4 or aged 10 to 14 at the time of the interview. The child and the child's primary female caregiver are the focus of the study. Extensive baseline information was gathered at the initial personal interview with the caregivers, tested younger children were assessed, and older children were interviewed. All interviews were conducted in-person using a computerized instrument. The third wave of data collection took place between February 2005 and January 2006, when the focal children were aged 5 to 10 or aged 15 to 20.  Between May 2005 and May 2006, interviews were conducted with the teachers of the focal children.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

              " \"\\\\u003eThe Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality was designed to\\\\nbroaden the understanding of how changing labor market dynamics,\\\\nracial attitudes and stereotypes, and racial residential segregation\\\\nact singly and in concert to foster contemporary urban\\\\ninequality. This data collection comprises data for two surveys: a\\\\nsurvey of households and a survey of employers. Multistage area\\\\nprobability sampling of adult residents took place in four\\\\nmetropolitan areas: Atlanta (April 1992-September 1992), Boston (May\\\\n1993-November 1994), Detroit (April-September 1992), and Los Angeles\\\\n(September 1993-August 1994). The combined four-city data file in Part\\\\n1 contains data on survey questions that were asked in households in\\\\nat least two of the four survey cities. Questions on labor market\\\\ndynamics included industry, hours worked per week, length of time on\\\\njob, earnings before taxes, size of employer, benefits provided,\\\\ninstances of harassment and discrimination, and searching for work\\\\nwithin particular areas of the metropolis in which the respondent\\\\nresided. Questions covering racial attitudes and attitudes about\\\\ninequality centered on the attitudes and beliefs that whites, Blacks,\\\\nLatinos, and Asians hold about one another, including amount of\\\\ndiscrimination, perceptions about wealth and intelligence, ability to\\\\nbe self-supporting, ability to speak English, involvement with drugs\\\\nand gangs, the fairness of job training and educational assistance\\\\npolicies, and the fairness of hiring and promotion\\\\npreferences. Residential segregation issues were studied through\\\\nmeasures of neighborhood quality and satisfaction, and preferences\\\\nregarding the racial/ethnic mix of neighborhoods. Other topics\\\\nincluded residence and housing, neighborhood characteristics, family\\\\nincome structure, networks and social functioning, and interviewer\\\\nobservations. Demographic information on household respondents was\\\\nalso elicited, including length of residence, education, housing\\\\nstatus, monthly rent or mortgage payment, marital status, gender, age,\\\\nrace, household composition, citizenship status, language spoken in\\\\nthe home, ability to read and speak English, political affiliation,\\\\nand religion. The data in Part 2 represent a telephone survey of\\\\ncurrent business establishments in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los\\\\nAngeles carried out between spring 1992 and spring 1995 to learn about\\\\nhiring and vacancies, particularly for jobs requiring just a high\\\\nschool education. An employer size-weighted, stratified, probability\\\\nsample (approximately two-thirds of the cases) was drawn from regional\\\\nemployment directories, and a probability sample (the other third of\\\\nthe cases) was drawn from the current or most recent employer reported\\\\nby respondents to the household survey in Part 1. Employers were\\\\nqueried about characteristics of their firms, including composition of\\\\nthe firm's labor force, vacant positions, the person most recently\\\\nhired and his or her salary, hours worked per week, educational\\\\nqualifications, promotions, the firm's recruiting and hiring methods,\\\\nand demographic information for the respondent, job applicants, the\\\\nfirm's customers, and the firm's labor force, including age,\\\\neducation, race, and gender.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

The data collection was divided into six discrete projects centered around each of the cities of interest: Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Each research team was responsible for identifying the 15 organizations in their city that fit the criteria of largest 501(c)(3): secular hospital, Protestant hospital, Catholic hospital, Jewish hospital, art museum, symphony orchestra, United Way, institution of higher education, Junior League, community foundation, YMCA, YWCA, secular family services, Catholic family services, and Jewish family services. The process resulted in a board-level data set of about ninety organizations that would be directly comparable across cities; researchers then collected demographic information on the trustees of each organization during the years 1931, 1961, and 1991. Researchers collected data on 8,926 individual trustees from 289 separate boards (approximately 15 organizations' boards for each of six cities over three different time periods). The data set archived at the Cultural Policy and the Arts National Data Archive (CPANDA) was missing data for 22 entire boards (see Collection Note 2).\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

              " \"\\\\u003eThe Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality was designed to broaden the understanding of how changing labor market dynamics, racial attitudes and stereotypes, and racial residential segregation act singly and in concert to foster contemporary urban inequality. This data collection comprises data for two surveys: a survey of households and a survey of employers. Multistage area probability sampling of adult residents took place in four metropolitan areas: Atlanta (April 1992-September 1992), Boston (May 1993-November 1994), Detroit (April-September 1992), and Los Angeles (September 1993-August 1994). The combined four-city data file in Part 1 contains data on survey questions that were asked in households in at least two of the four survey cities. Questions on labor market dynamics included industry, hours worked per week, length of time on job, earnings before taxes, size of employer, benefits provided, instances of harassment and discrimination, and searching for work within particular areas of the metropolis in which the respondent resided. Questions covering racial attitudes and attitudes about inequality centered on the attitudes and beliefs that whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians hold about one another, including amount of discrimination, perceptions about wealth and intelligence, ability to be self-supporting, ability to speak English, involvement with drugs and gangs, the fairness of job training and educational assistance policies, and the fairness of hiring and promotion preferences. Residential segregation issues were studied through measures of neighborhood quality and satisfaction, and preferences regarding the racial/ethnic mix of neighborhoods. Other topics included residence and housing, neighborhood characteristics, family income structure, networks and social functioning, and interviewer observations. Demographic information on household respondents was also elicited, including length of residence, education, housing status, monthly rent or mortgage payment, marital status, gender, age, race, household composition, citizenship status, language spoken in the home, ability to read and speak English, political affiliation, and religion. The data in Part 2 represent a telephone survey of current business establishments in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles carried out between spring 1992 and spring 1995 to learn about hiring and vacancies, particularly for jobs requiring just a high school education. An employer size-weighted, stratified, probability sample (approximately two-thirds of the cases) was drawn from regional employment directories, and a probability sample (the other third of the cases) was drawn from the current or most recent employer reported by respondents to the household survey in Part 1. Employers were queried about characteristics of their firms, including composition of the firm's labor force, vacant positions, the person most recently hired and his or her salary, hours worked per week, educational qualifications, promotions, the firm's recruiting and hiring methods, and demographic information for the respondent, job applicants, the firm's customers, and the firm's labor force, including age, education, race, and gender.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",

              " '\\\\u003eMoving to Opportunity (MTO) was designed to answer questions about what happens when very poor families have the chance to move out of subsidized housing in the poorest neighborhoods of five very large American cities. MTO was a demonstration program: its approach combined tenant-based housing vouchers with location restrictions and housing counseling. MTO was also a randomized social experiment, carefully designed and rigorously implemented to test the effects of this approach on participating families. The interim evaluation included the collection of data on a wide range of outcomes that could potentially be affected by the MTO intervention. These outcomes fit into 6 study domains: (1) mobility, housing, and neighborhood, (2) adult and child physical and mental health, (3) child educational achievement, (4) youth delinquency and risky behavior, (5) adult and youth employment and earnings, and (6) household income and public assistance receipt. The restricted access data being made available through ICPSR includes many such analytic variables constructed from surveys and administrative data. The Tier 1 data also includes a census tract ID that allows researchers to link other neighborhood-level data.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e',\n",

The project investigates the strategies families have used to respond to reform, in terms of employment, schooling or other forms of training, residential mobility, and fertility. Central to this project is a focus on how these strategies affect children's lives, with an emphasis on their health and development as well as their need for, and use of, social services. For the first wave of the study, between March 1999 and December 1999, a random sample of approximately 2,400 households with children in low-income neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio were selected for interviews. Forty percent of the families interviewed were receiving cash welfare payments at the time of the interview. Each household had a child aged 0 to 4 or aged 10 to 14 at the time of the interview. The child and the child's primary female caregiver are the focus of the study. Extensive baseline information was gathered at the initial personal interview with the caregivers, tested younger children were assessed, and older children were interviewed. All interviews were conducted in-person using a computerized instrument. The third wave of data collection took place between February 2005 and January 2006, when the focal children were aged 5 to 10 or aged 15 to 20.  Between May 2005 and May 2006, interviews were conducted with the teachers of the focal children.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\",\n",
